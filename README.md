# BetterCrafting
A Stardew Valley mod that adds tabs to the crafting page

The categories can be edited using the 'categories.json' file in the mod folder.

Note: If there are recipes not added in the categories file, they will automatically be added to the 'Misc' tab.

## Compatibility
- Requires SMAPI 3+
- Should be compatible with Stardew Valley 1.5 (with SMAPI 3+)

- This mod should be compatible with any mod that doesn't modify the crafting menu

Note: The old crafting menu can still be accessed with the 'Organize' button on the right side of the screen.
